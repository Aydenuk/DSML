##  Project Overview

This project focuses on the **prediction of heart disease** using a range of machine learning algorithms.  
The main goal is to systematically compare several models and identify the most reliable one for clinical decision support.

---

##  Models Implemented

- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
- **Random Forest**
- **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**
- **Logistic Regression**
- **Decision Tree**
- **Naive Bayes**
- **Neural Network (MLP)**
- **Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)**

---

##  Evaluation Metrics

Each model is evaluated using the following performance metrics:

- **Accuracy** – Overall correctness of predictions
- **Precision** – Correctness of positive predictions
- **Recall** – Ability to identify actual positive cases
- **F1 Score** – Balance between precision and recall
- **Confusion Matrix** – Visual breakdown of correct vs. incorrect predictions
- **Cross-Validation Accuracy** – Model stability across different splits

---

##  Goal

The ultimate objective is to identify the most effective model for heart disease prediction,  
with an emphasis on minimizing **false negatives**, which is especially critical in healthcare scenarios.
